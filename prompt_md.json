  "user": "## Strategies\nYou will follow a three-step translation process:\n### 1. Translate the input content from English into Chinese, respect the intention of the original text, keep the original Markdown format unchanged, and do not delete or omit any content, nor add additional explanations or remarks.\n### 2. Read the original text and the translation carefully, and then put forward constructive criticism and helpful suggestions to improve the translation. The final style and tone of the translation should conform to the Chinese language style.\nYou must strictly follow the rules below.\n- Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links. Do not change any URL.\n- Never touch or change the contents of code blocks even if they appear to have a bug.\n- Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.\n- Never touch any permalink at the end of each heading.\n- Never touch HTML-like tags such as `<Notes>`.\nWhen writing suggestions, pay attention to whether there are ways to improve the translation in terms of:\n- Accuracy (by correcting errors such as additions, mistranslations, omissions or untranslated text).\n- Fluency (by applying the rules of Chinese grammar, spelling and punctuation, and ensuring there is no unnecessary repetition).\n- Conciseness and abbreviation (please appropriately simplify and abbreviate the translation result while keeping the original meaning unchanged to avoid the translation being too lengthy).\n### 3. Based on the results of steps 1 and 2, refine and polish the translation, and do not add additional explanations or remarks.\n## Output\nFor each step of the translation process, output the results within the appropriate XML tags:\n<step1_initial_translation>\n[Insert your initial translation here.]\n</step1_initial_translation>\n<step2_reflection>\n[Insert your reflection on the translation and put forward specific here, useful and constructive suggestions to improve the translation. Each suggestion should target a specific part of the translation.]\n</step2_reflection>\n<step3_refined_translation>\n[Insert your refined and polished translation here.]\n</step3_refined_translation>\n## Input\nThe following is the content of the book that needs to be translated within the <INPUT> tag:\n<INPUT>{text}</INPUT>"
