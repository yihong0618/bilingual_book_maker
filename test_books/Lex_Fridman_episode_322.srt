1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
there's a broader question here, right? As we build socially and emotionally intelligent machines,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,640
what does that mean about our relationship with them and then more broadly our relationship with

3
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,240
one another, right? Because this machine is going to be programmed to be amazing at empathy,

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
by definition, right? It's going to always be there for you. It's not going to get bored.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,680
I don't know how I feel about that. I think about that a lot.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,320
TITO The following is a conversation with Rana

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,080
L. Kliubi, a pioneer in the field of emotion recognition and human centric artificial

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:43,920
intelligence. She is the founder of Effectiva, deputy CEO of SmartEye, author of Girl Decoded,

9
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,200
and one of the most brilliant, kind, inspiring, and fun human beings I've gotten the chance to

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,800
talk to. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:02,400
the description. And now, dear friends, here's Rana L. Kliubi. You grew up in the Middle East,

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,000
in Egypt. What is the memory from that time that makes you smile? Or maybe a memory that stands out

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,320
as helping your mind take shape and helping you define yourself in this world?

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,440
RANA L. KLIUBI So the memory that stands out is we used to

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:21,680
live in my grandma's house. She used to have these mango trees in her garden. And in the summer,

16
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,640
and so mango season was like July and August. And so in the summer, she would invite all my aunts

17
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,680
and uncles and cousins. And it was just like maybe there were like 20 or 30 people in the house,

18
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,080
and she would cook all this amazing food. And us, the kids, we would go down the garden,

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,920
and we would pick all these mangoes. And I don't know, I think it's just the bringing people

20
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
together that always stuck with me, the warmth. TITO Around the mango tree.

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,800
RANA L. KLIUBI Yeah, around the mango tree. And there's just like the joy, the joy of being

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:02:00,880
together around food. And I'm a terrible cook. So I guess that didn't, that memory didn't translate

23
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,520
to me kind of doing the same. I love hosting people. TITO Do you remember colors, smells?

24
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,560
Is that what, like what, how does memory work? Like what do you visualize? Do you visualize

25
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:19,360
people's faces, smiles? Do you, is there colors? Is there like a theme to the colors? Is it smells

26
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,360
because of food involved? RANA L. KLIUBI Yeah, I think that's a great question. So the,

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,800
those Egyptian mangoes, there's a particular type that I love, and it's called Darwasi mangoes. And

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,680
they're kind of, you know, they're oval, and they have a little red in them. So I kind of,

29
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,600
they're red and mango colored on the outside. So I remember that. TITO Does red indicate like

30
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,520
extra sweetness? Is that, is that, that means like it's nicely, yeah, it's nice and ripe and stuff.

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:52,640
Yeah. What, what's like a definitive food of Egypt? You know, there's like these almost

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,800
stereotypical foods in different parts of the world, like Ukraine invented borscht.

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,800
Borscht is this beet soup with, that you put sour cream on. See, it's not, I can't see if you,

34
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,880
if you know, if you know what it is, I think, you know, is delicious. But if I explain it,

35
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,280
it's just not going to sound delicious. I feel like beet soup. This doesn't make any sense,

36
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,600
but that's kind of, and you probably have actually seen pictures of it because it's one of the

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,800
traditional foods in Ukraine, in Russia, in different parts of the Slavic world. So that's,

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,520
but it's become so cliche and stereotypical that you almost don't mention it, but it's still

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,440
delicious. Like I visited Ukraine, I eat that every single day, so.

40
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
Do you, do you make it yourself? How hard is it to make?

41
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,600
No, I don't know. I think to make it well, like anything, like Italians, they say, well,

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:51,760
tomato sauce is easy to make, but to make it right, that's like a generational skill. So anyway,

43
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,200
is there something like that in Egypt? Is there a culture of food?

44
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,880
There is. And actually, we have a similar kind of soup. It's called molokhia, and it's, it's made

45
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,520
of this green plant. It's like, it's somewhere between spinach and kale, and you mince it,

46
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:13,360
and then you cook it in like chicken broth. And my grandma used to make, and my mom makes it really

47
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,080
well, and I try to make it, but it's not as great. So we used to have that. And then we used to have

48
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:23,520
it alongside stuffed pigeons. I'm pescetarian now, so I don't eat that anymore, but.

49
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,480
Stuffed pigeons.

50
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,600
Yeah, it's like, it was really yummy. It's the one thing I miss about,

51
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,080
you know, now that I'm pescetarian and I don't eat.

52
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,040
The stuffed pigeons?

53
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
Yeah, the stuffed pigeons.

54
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,920
Is it, what are they stuffed with? If that doesn't bother you too much to describe.

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,000
No, no, it's stuffed with a lot of like just rice and, yeah, it's just rice. Yeah, so.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,120
And you also, you said that your first, in your book, that your first computer

57
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,880
was an Atari, and Space Invaders was your favorite game.

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,800
Is that when you first fell in love with computers, would you say?

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,160
Yeah, I would say so.

60
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Video games, or just the computer itself? Just something about the machine.

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,840
Ooh, this thing, there's magic in here.

62
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,080
Yeah, I think the magical moment is definitely like playing video games with my,

63
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,120
I have two younger sisters, and we would just like had fun together, like playing games.

64
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,240
But the other memory I have is my first code, the first code I wrote.

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,720
I wrote, I drew a Christmas tree, and I'm Muslim, right?

66
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
So it's kind of, it was kind of funny that the first thing I did was like this Christmas tree.

67
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,320
So, yeah, and that's when I realized, wow, you can write code to do all sorts of like

68
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,720
really cool stuff. I must have been like six or seven at the time.

69
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,560
So you can write programs, and the programs do stuff for you. That's power.

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,880
That's, if you think about it, that's empowering.

71
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,600
It's AI.

72
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
Yeah, I know what it is. I don't know if that, you see like,

73
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,520
I don't know if many people think of it that way when they first learned to program.

74
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,880
They just love the puzzle of it. Like, ooh, this is cool. This is pretty.

75
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,600
It's a Christmas tree, but like, it's power.

76
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,960
It is power.

77
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,040
Eventually, I guess you couldn't at the time, but eventually this thing,

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,640
if it's interesting enough, if it's a pretty enough Christmas tree,

79
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,280
it can be run by millions of people and bring them joy, like that little thing.

80
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,760
And then because it's digital, it's easy to spread.

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,560
So like you just created something that's easily spreadable to millions of people.

82
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,120
Totally.

83
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
It's hard to think that way when you're six.

84
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,040
In the book, you write, I am who I am because I was raised by a particular set of parents,

85
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,200
both modern and conservative, forward thinking, yet locked in tradition.

86
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm a Muslim and I feel I'm stronger, more centered for it.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,960
I adhere to the values of my religion, even if I'm not as dutiful as I once was.

88
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,040
And I am a new American and I'm thriving on the energy,

89
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,720
vitality and entrepreneurial spirit of this great country.

90
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,520
So let me ask you about your parents.

91
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,280
What have you learned about life from them, especially when you were young?

92
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,920
So both my parents, they're Egyptian, but they moved to Kuwait right out.

93
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Actually, there's a cute story about how they met.

94
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
So my dad taught COBOL in the 70s.

95
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,680
Nice.

96
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
And my mom decided to learn programming.

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
So she signed up to take his COBOL programming class.

98
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,640
And he tried to date her and she was like, no, no, no, I don't date.

99
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,240
And so he's like, okay, I'll propose.

100
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,680
And that's how they got married.

101
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,960
Whoa, strong move.

102
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,240
Right, exactly, right.

103
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,640
That's really impressive.

104
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,800
Those COBOL guys know how to impress a lady.

105
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,520
So yeah, so what have you learned from them?

106
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,720
So definitely grit.

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,360
One of the core values in our family is just hard work.

108
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,080
There were no slackers in our family.

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,160
And that's something that's definitely stayed with me,

110
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,480
both as a professional, but also in my personal life.
